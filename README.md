# LOCKUP
Harddisk Lock/Unlock Utility


With LOCKUP, you can protect your hard disk from intruders.
The working mechanism of LOCKUP is very simple; It copies the HDD's data on cylinder:0 track:0 sector:0 to the floppy disk and fills this area (cylinder:0 track:0 sector:0) with zero value.
When user wants to make HDD work normally, this time LOCKUP restores data from floppy disk to cylinder:0 track:0 sector:0 of HDD.
